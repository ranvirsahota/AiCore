Check your loop condition and ensure that it eventually evaluates to False to exit the loop. Additionally, ensure that your loop logic includes a way to progress towards the exit condition.\n",

        "- For loops are used to iterate over elements in an iterable object such as strings, lists, tuples, or ranges\n",
        "- The `range()` function is commonly used to generate a sequence of numbers that can be used in for loops\n",
        "- Nested for loops allow you to perform repetitive actions within repetitive actions, enabling you to handle multidimensional data structures and perform complex operations\n",
        "- The `zip()` function combines multiple iterables into a single iterable, allowing you to iterate over them in parallel\n",
        "- The `enumerate()` function provides an index value along with the elements of an iterable, making it useful when you need to track the index during iteration\n",
        "- Control statements such as `break`, `continue`, and `else` can be used within for loops to modify the flow of execution"
