# Structured Data vs Unstructured Data
A way to classify diffeent data types

## Structured Data
You know what will be found, for example:
- Tabular Data - a table has columns and rows, the columns define the data and rows popular
    - In table you know data in rows will correspond to the coloum name and in format so level will be
      a integer representing level, epxert will boolean and name will always be a string of characters
- Strucutred is always know so for tabular data, wherether is 1st row or 600th row coloumns will mean
  the same 
    | Name      | Level     | Expert     |
    | :---      | :---      | :---    
    | Gale      | 12        | False      |
    | Geralt    | 36        | True       |
    | Rambo     | 20        | True       |
     
## Unstructured Data
 - You do not know what you will found. txt data is **unstructured**
 - In a txt/pdf...etc file you can never be sure the first text encrouted will always be a header
   sometimes it might all be regualar text, you can even have different types of headings (h1, h2, ...)
- Other types:
    - Audio
    - Video
    - Image/Satalite Images
    - Medical scans

- Unstructured Data can also be known as **Complex Data** as all/most data has **some**
  structure, so unstrcutured data can be seen as misleading
