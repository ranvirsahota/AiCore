# To ensure code quality:
## 1. Be consistent with:
- Variables names
- Diffeent variables names used to refer to the same thing/object/topic
- What code is put into methods
## 2. Ensure variables named clearly
- No single letter variables
- No accroynoms
- **DON NOT SACRIFICE READABILITY FOR SHORTING VARIABLE NAME LENGTH**
## 3. Check abstraction has been used to show right level of detail
- DO NOT ABSTRACT SO MUCH THAT USEFUL FUNCTIONALITY IS HIDDEN
## 4. Check inheritiance has been used where appropriate
## 5. Has all related fucnntionality been put into their correct umberala class
## 6. Use polymorphsim correctly by examining for any methods with similar behaviour
## 7. Make code efficeint, profile and time
## 8. Keep code DRY - (DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF)
## 9. Stick python guideline, such as PEP8
