        "First we apply the statement `WHERE rental_rate > 0.99` this allows us to focus only on non-budget movies. We then perform the `GROUP BY` on the `rating` column to group the movies into their respective ratings. We then `SELECT` the `SUM` of of the total `rental_rate` and `rental_duration` to get the total possible value of the rentals in that `rating` category. We finally apply our `HAVING` statement to only display film rating having a value of over 2500.\n",

        "- `GROUP BY` can be powerful when you want to perform analysis on groups of your data\n",

        "- Since you will be performing aggregations with the `GROUP BY` statement remember to **alias** your columns so the resultant data makes sense\n",
        "- It can be useful to perform on `SELECT` statement on the data first so you can view which groups you want to perform a `GROUP BY` on\n",
        "- Remember that columns selected in your `SELECT` statement need to either be included in the `GROUP BY` statement or **aggregated** in the `SELECT` statement\n",
        "- You can use the `HAVING` statement to perform filtering after the `GROUP BY` has taken place\n"
